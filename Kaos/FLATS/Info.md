I suggest you place all FLATS into the TEXTURE folder since GZDoom does not
care. But this is still a valid folder if you want to use it for FLATS.

As mentioned in the READ ME, I suggest that each source of custom files get its
own subfolder.

That maske it easier to edit or delete files that you no longer want to use.
Fell free to add anything into the FLAT folder if you want to though, it is
your project. ;-)
